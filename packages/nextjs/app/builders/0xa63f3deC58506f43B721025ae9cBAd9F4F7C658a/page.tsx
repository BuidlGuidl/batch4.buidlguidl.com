            One day, during the pandemic, I had a decision to make: keep living like I was, working on something I
            didn`t felt excited about, or to <strong>make a big leap of faith.</strong> And I`ve decided to become a
            programmer.
            <br />
            <br />
            Since then I`ve been working on my craft daily.
            <br />
            <br />
            I got my first job as a front-end in 2021, then became a full stack, and in the middle of the way, I found
            crypto.
            <br />
            <br />
            Started out as a ETH miner (didn`t go so well lol), than an investor, and now I`m making a second leap of
            faith in my life. Going all in, becoming a web3 developer.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal is to code user first applications, I believe that we are building a new way of working together as
            a society, and not only I want to be part of that, but I will scream to the seven seas. This is our future!

            I love gaming, running (on my way to my first 21k), sci-fi (Star Wars was my first love, Dune is my affair),
            electronic music (techno, trance, d&b..), hardware (built a few pcs) and of course, traveling!
